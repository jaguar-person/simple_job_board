Project focused on frontend development by Svelte (sveltekit)

The backend of this application was created using PocketBase - a low-to-no-code solution to creating CRUD backends. This project is mainly focused on the frontend development using Svelte (Sveltekit).

As bootcamp candidates are sharing the same backend, the deployed frontend: https://svelte-frontend-project.pages.dev/ is unable to perform some API requests such as showing the new job posted in main page and edit details of job posted. However, all these API requests are tested and works in development environment.

- testing CRUD API via Insomnia
- build UI UX
- user able to sign up, sign in, update password, delete account, check details of all job posted, post new job, edit details of posted job, delete posted job
- deployed via cloudflare
